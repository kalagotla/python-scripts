# python-scripts
Some python scripts over the years of graduate school work

MATH* Files are related to Math-Programming course work from 2016

Named files -- Aatresh,Amit... are related to help for some friends

post_script.py might be the most used file. It can post-process data
generated from MV3 (Particle data) to generate
1. Fluid vs Particle line plots
2. Fluid/Particle data contours -- Velocity, Acceleration, Velocity difference
3. P3D file for Tecplot post-processing

CFD.py, PIV.py -- Generates plots, contours for P3D data types specific
to UM PIV data

error_metric.py -- Computes error metric b/w CFD, PIV, Num-PIV data

OSWPI, SWPI, SWPI1 -- Based on inputs generate flow data of a shock wave

Other files -- Most are self explonatory based on their names such as Simpsons,
pascalTriangle etc...

I will add commits whenever changes are made
